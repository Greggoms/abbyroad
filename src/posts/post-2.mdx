This depends on many factors, namely your circumstances and who you ask. The biggest question you must answer is “Why do I want to use this product?” The following will cover the answer “I’m in pain and don’t want to use expensive medications.”

If you have no experience using any sort of cannabinoid, we suggest starting with CBD. If you have tried CBD and was not impressed, but don’t want to use THC, delta 8 could be perfect for you. It provides a very noticeable effect, but it won’t be as intense as THC. If delta 8 doesn’t appeal to you for one reason or another, talk to your doctor about obtaining a medical marijuana card.

## What kind of benefits can I expect?

The biggest reason to use these products is to receive a form of medicinal benefit. Some benefits are shared between products, but one may have advantages over the other. Keep in mind that CBD and THC are not a ‘miracle cure’ for all ailments. They can simply ease some conditions temporarily.

CBD is used to help with various conditions, such as:

- Anxiety
- Pain
- Nausea
- Seizures
- Inflammation
- Psychosis or mental disorders
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Migraine
- Depression

THC is used to help with the following:

- Anxiety
- Pain
- Nausea
- Muscle spasticity
- Glaucoma
- Insomnia
- Low appetite

## What is the best way to consume it?

There are many ways to consume these products. They can come in the form of flower, pre-filled oil cartridges, disposable vapes, vape oil, oral tincture, edibles, pill capsules, and topicals/lotions. This ultimately depends on personal preference, but some methods can prove to be more effective than others.

### Flower

This is arguably one of the most effective consumption methods. It is straight from the source and is the least processed. The effects take only minutes to have an impact. Effects can last a few hours. This method of consumption is mildly harsh and will cause coughing. It also leaves a lingering odor.

### Pre-filled oil cartridges

Heavy cannabinoid users may find this to be their preferred method. The oil in these cartridges is concentrated to maximum potency. This means it is very effective, but also very harsh. It may cause coughing, but it is normal and to be expected. With concentrated products like this, a little bit goes a long way. The effects are nearly immediate and last a few hours. These cartridges tend to have a better flavor compared to flower, and the odor dissipates rather quickly.

### Disposable vapes

These work very similarly to the pre-filled oil cartridges. The main difference is the cartridges require a separate device to fire them. Disposables, however, are an all-in-one solution. Most can be recharged but must be disposed of once out of oil. Disposable vapes and pre-filled cartridges are not meant to be refilled. Doing so can cause unexpected complications.

### Vape oil

This option may appeal to current e-juice vapers that already have a vaping setup. These bottles are typically CBD only, as it’s more beneficial to make THC or the Delta hybrids into one of the above concentrated forms instead. Vape oil is very watery and typically clear in color. Concentrated oils are very thick and typically yellow or orange-ish. Concentrated oil is not recommended for use in a vape tank. The effectiveness depends on the strength but will never be as effective as the other methods. It can take from 30 minutes to an hour to notice the effects, and they don’t stick around for too long. This method is more beneficial if used alongside another form of consumption. For example, you can take an edible and occasionally top it off with vape oil. These oils are very mild and typically don’t cause a coughing fit.
NOTE: If you are unsure if the oil you have is vapable, look for vegetable glycerin (VG) and propylene glycol (PG) in the ingredients list. These are the chemicals used in all vape e-juices.

### Oral tincture

This and the remaining methods don’t require you to inhale/exhale a smoke vapor.

These typically come in 30mL sized bottles with an eyedropper attached to the lid. An eyedropper full is ~1mL of liquid and is usually the recommended dose. Again, the effectiveness depends on the strength, but the body processes this method more efficiently than the vape oil and can be more effective overall. Effect timing varies on the strength and the product itself. It could take seconds, or it could take around 45 minutes. These tinctures can usually be mixed into a drink if the flavor is too strong on its own. These are typically CBD only as well, as consuming THC oil would not be a pleasant experience.
NOTE: If you are unsure if the oil you have is a tincture, look for coconut oil or a similar oil in the ingredients list. If you see vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol, it is meant to be vaped, but can be used as a tincture as well.

### Edibles

This is a surprisingly effective way to receive benefits, especially if you really don’t want to inhale/exhale smoke. These come in different strengths as well, but it’s recommended to take 1-2 gummies at a time. Effects are noticeable around 45 minutes and stay around a few hours.

### Pill capsules

These work the same as most pill medications. It takes around 45 minutes for it to metabolize and release the effects and can stay in effect for many hours.

### Topicals/Lotions

This method suits those who are adamant against consuming these cannabinoids. Using a topical significantly reduces the benefits you receive and is typically used for exterior pains such as joint pain and aches. This is the only method that does not introduce the cannabinoids into the bloodstream, which makes it less effective overall.
